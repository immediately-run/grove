# Brief 08 — The story river (a TiddlyWiki-style reading mode)

A second way to read a Grove: instead of one entry per page, the reader keeps a **single
column of open entries — the story river** — and following a link opens the target as a
new card in that column. This is an homage to TiddlyWiki, one of immediately.run's
inspirations. It is built as a **separate app on top of Grove**, so every surface here is
Grove's existing vocabulary rearranged, not a new visual language.

**For:** Claude Design (or any designer, human or agent).
**Read with:** [`../HANDOFF.md`](../HANDOFF.md) and [`00-foundation`](./00-foundation.md)
(the brand, tokens, wiki-link states and motifs — all hold here unchanged),
[`01-reading-view`](./01-reading-view.md) (the entry you are now putting in a card),
[`02-shell-navigation-and-authoring`](./02-shell-navigation-and-authoring.md) (the chrome
around the river). **The behaviour contract** is the docs repo's
`content/specs/APP_CUSTOMIZATION_SPEC.mdx` §6. Where this brief and §6 disagree, §6 wins;
flag the disagreement rather than designing around it.

## What you're designing, in one paragraph

A reading surface where entries **accumulate** instead of replacing each other. The reader
starts with one card (say, *Engineering*). They click *Ada Lovelace* inside it, and an
*Ada Lovelace* card slides in directly below. They click *Engineering* again from Ada's
card: nothing new opens; the view scrolls back up to the Engineering card and briefly marks
it. They close Ada's card with its **×**. The URL always describes the river, so a shared
link or a reload reproduces it exactly. Design the river page, the card, every state a card
can be in, the motion for open / focus / close, and the chrome around the river, at
desktop and mobile widths, in dark and light.

## The five interactions (design each one as a sequence, not a still)

| # | Reader does | What must be visible |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Clicks a link, inside a card, to an entry that is **not open** | A new card appears **directly below** the card containing the link, scrolls into view, takes focus. The reader must see where it came from. |
| 2 | Clicks a link in the **sidebar, nav or search** to an entry that is not open | A new card appears **at the top** of the river and takes focus. |
| 3 | Clicks a link to an entry that is **already open** | No new card. The view scrolls to the existing card, which gets a brief **"here it is"** highlight, then settles. The order doesn't change. |
| 4 | Closes a card | It leaves; the cards below close the gap; focus lands on the heading of the card that took its place. |
| 5 | Presses Back | The previous river comes back exactly: the last-opened card is gone again. No special UI — but the transition must not look like a crash. |

Interaction 3 is the one most likely to feel broken if under-designed: the reader clicked a
link and "nothing opened". The highlight has to read as a deliberate answer ("it's this
one, already open"), not a glitch.

## The card

A card is one Grove entry, reading exactly as in brief 01, inside a river-owned frame.

- **Header** (`.river-card__header`)
  - The entry title: Gabarito, ends on a period, may take the gradient clip like any entry
    title. This is the card's focus target and accessible name.
  - **Close** — Lucide `x`, 16–20px, `currentColor`, a 44×44 touch target on mobile.
    **Absent** on the only card in the river (the river is never empty).
  - **Copy link to this entry** — Lucide `link`. Copies a link that opens a river of just
    this card. Needs a quiet confirmation state ("Link copied.").
  - **Edit** — the existing Grove edit affordance (brief 02), shown only when the entry is
    writable. Don't redesign it; place it.
  - Optional: a mono micro-label with the entry's path or section (Space Mono,
    `--ink-3`), if it helps the reader tell cards apart in a long river. Your call — show
    with and without.
- **Body** — the entry's prose and components, as brief 01. **No section layout** (no
  hero band, no "more people" rail): a card is just the entry.
- **Footer** — the entry's metadata line and tags, as stock.

**Card separation is the central visual question.** Options to explore, not a
prescription: hairline-bordered `--panel` cards with `--r-lg`, versus borderless prose
divided by a hairline rule with the header as the only frame. Long cards must still read
as *one entry each* at a glance, and the brand's hard-offset hover shadow must not make a
whole card look clickable.

## Card states (each one needs a frame)

1. **Resting** — open, not focused.
2. **Focused** — the card the reader is on. Subtle: an accent hairline on the leading
   edge, or a header tint. It changes as the reader scrolls, so it must never be loud.
3. **Just opened** — the entrance (interaction 1 / 2).
4. **Found** — the "here it is" highlight (interaction 3). Short, decays to *focused*.
5. **Loading** — cards render lazily and a large entry takes seconds. A skeleton at a
   plausible height, with the title already shown (the river knows it before the body
   loads). Reuse brief 05's skeleton language.
6. **Closing** — the exit, and the gap closing behind it.
7. **Could not open** — a key in a shared link no longer exists. Don't draw a broken card:
   the river shows a single dismissible notice at the top ("1 entry in this link no longer
   exists.") and opens the rest.
8. **Read-only** — no edit affordance; nothing else changes.

## The page around the river

- **Desktop:** the stock Grove chrome (brief 02: nav, sidebar, search, theme control,
  footer) around a **single river column** at the reading measure (brief 00's ~68–72ch).
  A **rail** beside the river shows the **focused card's** table of contents and backlinks;
  it updates as focus moves. Design the moment the rail changes its content: it should be
  calm, not flicker on every scroll.
- **Sidebar and open cards:** the sidebar highlights the focused entry as it does today.
  Explore whether it should also **mark the other open entries** (a dot, a tick, a weight
  change) — that marker is how interaction 3 becomes predictable before the click.
- **Mobile (value 8 — not an afterthought):** one column, no rail. The card header may
  stick while its card is in view, so close and edit stay reachable in a long entry; show
  whether that helps or crowds the screen. The sidebar lives in the existing drawer.
  Interaction 1 on a phone scrolls the reader away from the link they tapped — show how
  they understand what happened and how they get back (Back, or scrolling up to the
  source card).
- **A long river:** show one with 8–10 cards, most collapsed out of view, to prove the
  page still has a shape and the focused card is findable.

## Motion

Restrained, as the brand requires (`.14s`-scale transitions). Open, close, and the found
highlight are the only animations. Everything has a **reduced-motion** variant: no slide,
no scroll animation — the card simply appears, and the highlight is a static outline that
fades.

## Sample content (use the real Grove corpus)

Grove's own sample wiki (`grove/content/`) is a fictional company, *Meridian*. Build the
mockup from it so the river looks like a real reading session:

- Start on *Home*. Open *Engineering* (`teams/engineering.mdx`) from the nav
  (interaction 2, top insert). In the Engineering card, open *Incident response*
  (`processes/incident-response.mdx`) from its prose, and *Ada Lovelace*
  (`people/ada-lovelace.mdx`) from its people directory (interaction 1, each directly
  below Engineering). In Ada's card, click "engineering" — Engineering is already open
  (interaction 3).
- Every sample entry is short (the longest is ~45 lines). For the long-card frames, extend
  *Onboarding* (`handbook/onboarding.mdx`) with plausible extra sections, and label the
  frame as padded sample content.

## Hard constraints

- **Tokens only.** Every colour, radius, shadow and font comes from `src/index.css`
  (`--bg`, `--panel`, `--panel-2`, `--ink`, `--ink-2`, `--ink-3`, `--line`, `--line-2`,
  `--accent`, `--accent-2`, `--grad`, `--r-*`, `--shadow-card`, `--disp`, `--sans`,
  `--mono`). New classes follow Grove's naming (`.river-*` beside the existing
  `.grove-*`), so a CSS-only theme can re-skin the river like everything else.
- **Dark default, light via `data-theme="light"`** — deliver both for the river page and
  the card states.
- **Sentence case, headlines end on a period, no emoji.** Icons are Lucide at 16–24px in
  `currentColor`: `x`, `link`, `pencil`, `chevron-*` as needed.
- **Don't draw host chrome.** The immediately.run host frame, sign-in, consent prompts and
  its seam or header UI are the host's. The river is inside the app's frame. Imitating host
  chrome is treated as spoofing.
- **One theme across the river.** Cards don't carry their own themes; the river takes the
  home entry's. Don't design per-card theming.
- **Accessibility:** each card is an `article` labelled by its title heading;
  close and copy are real buttons with labels; focus moves visibly on open and close; the
  found highlight isn't colour-only.

## Out of scope (don't design these)

Drag-to-reorder cards, editing inside a card, close-all / close-others, a
permalink-versus-permaview toggle, and any server or sync indicator. The river exists only
in the URL.

## Deliverables

1. The river page at **desktop and mobile**, dark and light, with the sample session above.
2. The **card** in all eight states.
3. **Sequences** (storyboards or prototype) for the five interactions, plus reduced-motion
   variants of 1, 3 and 4.
4. The **rail** (desktop) following focus, and the **sidebar** with the open-entry marker
   explored.
5. A **long river** (8–10 cards).
6. The river under **one alternate Grove theme** (brief 05's showcase) — same DOM, CSS
   only — to prove the new classes are themeable.
7. A short note on the open design questions below, with your recommendation.

## Open design questions (answer with a recommendation)

- **Card frame:** bordered panel or ruled prose (see *The card*)?
- **Focused-card indicator:** how quiet can it be and still be findable in a long river?
- **Chrome-link insertion:** the spec defaults sidebar/nav/search opens to the **top** of
  the river (TiddlyWiki's rule). If, deep in a long river, a top insert disorients more
  than it helps, say so and propose "below the focused card" instead.
- **Sticky card header on mobile:** does it earn its space?
