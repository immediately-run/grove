// R3-266 — the one place Grove decides whether to offer an edit, and how to deliver it.
//
// Every edit affordance in the wiki (the entry header's pencil, the 404's "Create it",
// the agent panel's link, the nav's "New entry") used to call `requestEdit` directly with
// a repo-relative path. That is correct for a FORK and wrong under DISPATCH, where it
// names a path in Grove's own repo rather than in the corpus on screen — so the affordance
// was withheld entirely and the wiki became read-only for the one packaging where the
// content is most obviously somebody's to edit.
//
// The decision is pure (`lib/editTarget`); this hook is the wiring: it reads the LIVE
// mount list so a role downgrade hides the affordance on the next render rather than
// producing `EROFS` on click, and it hands back one `openEditor(entryKey)` the chrome
// calls without knowing which packaging it is in.

   * the write lands in the corpus mount correctly, and *"open a PR against the content
   * repo"* has no wired target. That is real remaining work — and it is not a reason to
   * withhold editing, because a viewer that saves but cannot yet propose is strictly
   * better than one that refuses to save. It IS a reason not to imply otherwise, so the
   * chrome labels the dispatched case for what it is.
