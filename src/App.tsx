// The entry point immediately.run renders — deliberately a GATE, not the wiki.
//
// Grove ships in two packagings and they disagree about two things: where the corpus is,
// and who knows what is in it.
//
//   • FORK      — `/app/content/`, indexed by the bundler at build time. Both answers
//                 arrive before the app boots, so the gate falls straight through.
//   • DISPATCH  — a host-minted chroot at someone else's directory (R3-169), which the
//                 bundler never scanned, so the frontmatter index has to be BUILT
//                 (R3-265). Neither answer exists at first render.
//
// Every helper the wiki is made of — which keys are entries, what their hrefs are, which
// layouts wrap them — is a function of the root; every surface a reader sees — nav,
// sidebar, search, backlinks, routing, the 404 index — is a function of the index. A
// component that rendered before the root was settled would show the VIEWER's corpus, and
// then not correct itself; so would one that rendered with no index in scope, because the
// metadata hooks fall back to the host's store. So this file holds until the root is
// settled and the bundle is LISTED — every key known, rows filling in — and from then on
// always provides the bundle's index. Which rows an entry needs READ before it paints is
// GroveWiki's call (MDX_FROM_MOUNT_SPEC D8).
//
// Hence the split: this file resolves, `GroveWiki` renders.
