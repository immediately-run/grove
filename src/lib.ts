// The library entry (PLATFORM_LAYERING_SPEC §1.1 mode M3, R3-280).
//
// Grove composes with a corpus in three modes and this is the third: a thin shell — an
// ordinary `App.tsx` — imports the engine as a pinned dependency and arranges it, keeping
// ownership of composition without forking engine source. The other two modes are
// unchanged by this file: `src/App.tsx` is still the fork/dispatch entry immediately.run
// renders, and it is exported here too, so a shell that wants the whole wiki (gate
// included) mounts one component.
//
// What Grove IS, stated once because the packaging makes it answerable: a kit of React
// components, prebuilt layouts and themes that make a wiki easy to build and good-looking
// by default — NOT a wiki engine in the traditional sense. The parts a traditional wiki
// engine owns are cross-cutting platform concerns and live below this package: routing,
// MDX compilation, the frontmatter metadata index, link spaces, includes and heading
// anchors are sandbox + SDK, because every immediately.run app needs them and not only
// wikis. What is left here — and it is a real thing to own — is the vocabulary, the
// chrome, and the defaults.
//
// Exports only. No component is DEFINED here, so the Fast-Refresh rule is satisfied by
// re-export; the components themselves live one per file as they always did.
