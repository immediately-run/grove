          {/* Interpreter mode (R3-213) renders the raw entry as data — no author JS runs;
              executable mode compiles + runs the MDX via <Include>. Both are supported,
              and since R3-252 the choice is per-entry as well as wiki-wide.

              The compiled branch mounts <ScrollToFragment> too — deep-link landing is not
              a safe-path feature — but deliberately carries NO `data-entry` marker, and
              both halves of that are load-bearing (R3-252).

              `key={entryKey}` forces an unmount across a client-side navigation. Without
              it React reuses this subtree and keeps the PREVIOUS document mounted while
              the new one compiles, so `#sec-4` resolves against the wrong entry — every
              entry here numbers its sections from 1, so that lookup always succeeds and
              always lands wrong. Measured on the host: a citation to core_concepts §4
              ("4 — Principal") scrolled to a different document's "4. The provider-facing
              contract" (R3-249's hazard, reintroduced).

              No marker, because `<Include>` owns an internal <Suspense> and this wrapper
              is OUTSIDE it — so a marker here would appear the instant we navigate, while
              the body is still compiling, and claim a commit that has not happened. That
              is worse than no signal: `data-entry` means "this subtree holds entry X's
              committed body" everywhere else (`SafeEntryBody` puts it inside the suspended
              subtree, so it is true there), and the on-host harness waits on it. Keying
              already removes the hazard the marker defended against — the outgoing
              document is gone from the DOM, not lingering — so `resolveFragmentTarget`'s
              documented document-wide fallback for the compiled path is safe here. */}
