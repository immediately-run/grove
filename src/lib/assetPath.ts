// Entry-relative asset resolution (R3-313) — the ONE place that turns "an entry's
// `cover:`/`img src`" into the fs path the SDK's `MountImage` reads.
//
// The distinction this module exists for: a body image resolves against the entry
// CURRENTLY BEING RENDERED (`navigationState.sandboxPath` — `AssetImage`), while a
// cover resolves against its OWNING entry — the entry the card/row/tile is ABOUT,
// which under dispatch is usually a DIFFERENT base. Getting this wrong is not a bug
// in `AssetImage`; it is the second half of design-pass gap 7: a `<DocList>` card or
// `<Timeline>` row showing another entry's picture resolved against the wrong base
// by construction.
//
// Pure path arithmetic — no fs, no React — so the dispatch guarantee (the chroot
// prefix is host knowledge the viewer reads THROUGH but never publishes) is testable
// here in isolation.
