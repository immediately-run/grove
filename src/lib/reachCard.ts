  // answer. Round 1 caught the belt firing on the unanswered case and claiming a consent
  // state about a frame that may hold the grant.
  //
  // Wrong answer 1: gate on `catalog.length > 0`. That reads an empty ANSWER as silence,
  // which turns the G-GA-10 case below (a configured provider beside an empty catalog)
  // from a permanent correct ✗ into a permanent unbacked ✓ — the R-GA-1 violation this
  // card exists to prevent. Measured; two tests catch it.
  //
  // Wrong answer 2: declare it unfixable without an SDK change. Round 2 found it is
  // derivable here, because the push channel has no value-equality check — a second
  // notification means the host spoke, even when the value equals the initial `[]`. That
  // is `useCatalogAnswered()`.
  //
  // So: while the catalog is unanswered the row is NEUTRAL — no cause named. `catalogAnswered`
  // alone is not enough, because falling through to the ✓ arm would trade an under-claim
  // for an over-claim, and over-claiming is the one R-GA-1 forbids outright.
