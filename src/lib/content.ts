//
// The CANONICAL KEY in this app is the file's ABSOLUTE module/fs path, e.g.
// `/app/content/handbook/onboarding.mdx`. This is the SAME identifier used by:
//   • the metadata store — `useFileMetadata(key)` / `useMetadataQuery` are keyed
//     by it (since the bundler change "Key MDX metadata by the absolute /app
//     module path", sandbox #41 — metadata and modules now share one path);
//   • the fs / `<Include>` / `module.dynamicImport` / `fs.readFile` path space.
//
// So an entry's metadata is read and its body is rendered with the identical
// string — no more juggling two path spaces. The ONLY place a different space
// appears is the URL/href layer, which owns the `/files`↔APP_ROOT translation:
// `keyToHref` strips `/app` (the runtime <Link> then prepends `/files`), and
// `keyToRepoRel` strips `/app/` for requestEdit. Pure helpers — no components.
